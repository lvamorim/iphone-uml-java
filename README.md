## Description
**IPhone UML Java** is a project to study UML diagrams and its implementation using Java, inspired on some IPhone's essential functions, such as: `PhoneDevice`, `MusicPlayer` and `InternetBrowser`, each with specific methods of interaction, allowing user's input and executing operations based on data validity. The project was proposed by Digital Innovation One (DIO) to apply the knowledge gained from their courses.

## How to use
> ### ⚠ Pre-requisites:
> - [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
> - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice (e.g.: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/lvamorim/iphone-uml-java.git`.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. In `src/app` directory, try an operation:
> PhoneDevice - `call`, `answerCall` or `startVoicemail`.<br>
> MusicPlayer - `play`, `pause` or `selectSong`.<br>
> InternetBrowser - `showPage`, `addNewTab` or `refreshPage`.
4. Build and run the application.
5. Try different inputs.

## Techniques
- **List**: creating array to manage collections of data.
- **Stream**: using Java's Stream API to perform operations on data collections effectively.
- **Random**: generating random data to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Scanner**: taking the user's input enabling interaction with the app.
- **Exceptions**: handling exceptions with try-catch blocks to ensure the application's quality and provide user-friendly error messages.
